This is a library of tutorials made for and by Hydraulic and Offshore Engineering students at [**Delft University of Technology**](www.tudelft.nl). The goal of this library is two fold: to give visibility to the work of MSc students and to serve as guidance of new MSc thesis.

The collection of tutorials posted in this site are based on [*Gridap.jl*](https://gridap.github.io/Gridap.jl/stable/) a pure *Julia* Finite Element library. You will find tutorials related to MSc thesis from different masters, including:
- [Master of Offshore and Dredging Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/offshore-dredging-engineering/msc-offshore-dredging-engineering)
- [Master of Civil Engineering: Hydraulic Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/ce/msc-civil-engineering-test/old/old/old/oud/old/old/old/msc-programme/track-hydraulic-engineering)

- October 2021: [~~~<b>Very Large Floating Structures (VLFS)</b>~~~](/FSI/VLFS/VLFS) by Dorette Regout

This tutorial shows how to solve a Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) problem using Gridap and provides the instructions to build a 2D model considering a multi-module VLFS, solved in the frequency domain.

- July 2021: [~~~<b>Very Flexible Floating Structures (VFFS)</b>~~~](/FSI/VFFS/VFFS) by Sjoerd van Hoof

This tutorial shows how a Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) in a 2D domain is modelled. Potential flow is used to model the fluid and on top a Dynamic Euler-Bernoulli beam is located that serves as the floating structure.
