This is a library of tutorials made for and by Hydraulic and Offshore Engineering students at [**Delft University of Technology**](www.tudelft.nl). The goal of this library is to serve as guidance of new MSc thesis.

The collection of tutorials posted in this site are based on [*Gridap.jl*](https://gridap.github.io/Gridap.jl/stable/) a pure *Julia* Finite Element library. You will find tutorials related to MSc thesis from different masters, including:
- [Master of Offshore and Dredging Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/offshore-dredging-engineering/msc-offshore-dredging-engineering)
- [Master of Civil Engineering: Hydraulic Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/ce/msc-civil-engineering-test/old/old/old/oud/old/old/old/msc-programme/track-hydraulic-engineering)
